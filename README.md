# LSTM-RNN
LSTM-RNN simulation in C#

# Overview
**LSTM-RNN** is the project of graphical representation of the toy example - addition two numbers using LSTM RNN. The code is based on python implementation from https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/.

# Description
**LSTM-RNN** is a simple simulation of LSTM network working. 
The main goal is to provide the graphical interface, which shows simple vizualization of every step of learning the LSTM network. User can modify parameters of network such as binary dimension, hidden layer dimension, alpha ratio, number of iteration, seed for RNG.  After training, it's possible to show details of every iteration of learning process and test network. Application is created in C# in WFA.
